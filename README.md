Index of Personal Public Repositories
=====================================
IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: Most of these repositories do not actually hold any code, nor do they attempt to persuade any given individual to think or feel or do anything. These are artistic works, Documentation if you will in the form of Github Repositories for Art-based Research Projects. If there should be any doubt whatsoever about any of this, then either don't read it, move on, or you can contact me directly and I will remove anything that does not fit my highest standards of decency and prudence. I would not want to inadvertently post anything online that could harm anyone. In fact, the reason I created these was to try to find ways to make the world a safer place, using all of the gifts and talents that I have been grateful to receive. With that being said, I have gone at great lengths to ensure that no secret messages accidentally appear anywhere in my work that could be the cause of some confusion whatsoever in anyone. But there's a limit to what I can do. If someone is sick enough to try to read things into my work where there is nothing to read, I can't be held accountable for their thoughts or actions. But like I said, if anyone so much as suspects that there might accidentally be something anywhere on this account that could be misinterpreted, please contact me immediately and I will repair the ambiguity, disambiguate further so that no wrong interpretations can be made of what is mostly just text in Markdown format. But it is public, and I must take responsibility for it.

CONCEPT OF WORK: I was profoundly, earnestly inspired by a TEDTalk I saw a few years back, given by US Navy Admiral James Stavridis on the concept of "Open Source Security". Given that I had already been working as a visual artist and musical composer for most of my life, and had begun documenting my many artistic projects on this Github account, I decided to do a comprehensive analysis of the idea of having an "algorithm" of some sort that could never be corrupted. That is to say, no matter what came after it was written and run, it could never in any way possible be used to do anything other than the highest, greatest good. I realize that these are high standards and it is possibly impossible to accomplish or attain what is essentially an ideal, but that is what all of this is in any case: This is a concrete attempt at an exploration of the concept of something so good that it can only ever do good no matter what one tries to do with it, so much so that intentionally trying to cause harm or strife or pain or suffering or grief with it will always fail, universally, and only cause good to augment in the world, or be amplified. Call it a "Always Only Good Pass Filter" design concept.
