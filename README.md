IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: Most of these repositories do not actually hold any code, nor do they attempt to persuade any given individual to think or feel or do anything. These are artistic works, Documentation if you will in the form of Github Repositories for Art-based Research Projects. If there should be any doubt whatsoever about any of this, then either don't read it, move on, or you can contact me directly and I will remove anything that does not fit my highest standards of decency and prudence. I would not want to inadvertently post anything online that could harm anyone. In fact, the reason I created these was to try to find ways to make the world a safer place, using all of the gifts and talents that I have been grateful to receive. With that being said, I have gone at great lengths to ensure that no secret messages accidentally appear anywhere in my work that could be the cause of some confusion whatsoever in anyone. But there's a limit to what I can do. If someone is sick enough to try to read things into my work where there is nothing to read, I can't be held accountable for their thoughts or actions. But like I said, if anyone so much as suspects that there might accidentally be something anywhere on this account that could be misinterpreted, please contact me immediately and I will repair the ambiguity, disambiguate further so that no wrong interpretations can be made of what is mostly just text in Markdown format. But it is public, and I must take responsibility for it.

CONCEPT OF WORK: I was profoundly, earnestly inspired by a TED Talk I saw a few years back, given by US Navy Admiral James Stavridis on the concept of "Open Source Security". Given that I had already been working as a visual artist and musical composer for most of my life, and had begun documenting my many artistic projects on this Github account, I decided to do a comprehensive analysis of the idea of having an "algorithm" of some sort that could never be corrupted. That is to say, no matter what came after it was written and run, it could never in any way possible be used to do anything other than the highest, greatest good. I realize that these are high standards and it is possibly impossible to accomplish or attain what is essentially an ideal, but that is what all of this is in any case: This is a concrete attempt at an exploration of the concept of something so good that it can only ever do good no matter what one tries to do with it, so much so that intentionally trying to cause harm or strife or pain or suffering or grief with it will always fail, universally, and only cause good to augment in the world, or be amplified. Call it a "Always Only Good Pass Filter" design concept.
Reference for part of the inspiration to do only good with my many talents (ORIENTATION/REORIENTATION, SITUATION/SITUATEDNESS, etc.).

*UNESCO's 1980 Recommendation concerning the Status of the Artist was a significant step toward recognizing and improving the professional and social conditions of artists. It provided a comprehensive framework for member states to enhance the status of artists, promote artistic creation, and integrate the arts into broader cultural and social policies. By implementing these recommendations, UNESCO aimed to ensure that artists could contribute to cultural development and societal progress under conditions that respect their rights and professional needs. The following is something from that document which I find particularly pertinent and so mention it here:*


> __Considering__ that the artist plays an important role in the life and evolution of society and that he should be given the opportunity to contribute to society's development and, as any other citizen, to exercise his responsibilities therein, while preserving his creative inspiration and freedom of expression,
>
> __Further recognizing__ that the cultural, technological, economic, social and political development of society influences the status of the artist and that it is consequently necessary to review his status, taking account of social progress in the world,
> 
> __Affirming__ the right of the artist to be considered, if he so wishes, as a person actively engaged in cultural work and consequently to benefit, taking account of the particular 'conditions of his artistic profession, from all the legal, social and economic advantages pertaining to the status of workers...

__THE MISSION: PRESERVING THE DOCUMENTARY (CULTURAL) HERITAGE OF HUMANKIND:__

*Organizing a concerted, international effort to preserve the documentary (cultural) heritage of humankind requires a multifaceted approach involving collaboration among various stakeholders, governments, organizations, and individuals. Here are several ways to achieve this goal:*

1. __International Cooperation and Partnerships__: Foster collaboration among countries, international organizations, NGOs, and cultural institutions to develop comprehensive strategies for preserving documentary heritage. Platforms like UNESCO serve as key facilitators for international cooperation in this regard.

2. __Legislative Frameworks and Policies__: Establish robust legislative frameworks and policies at the national and international levels to protect and preserve documentary heritage. These frameworks should address issues such as copyright, intellectual property rights, access to information, and repatriation of cultural artifacts.

3. __Capacity Building and Training__: Provide training programs and capacity-building initiatives for archivists, librarians, museum professionals, and other stakeholders involved in the preservation of documentary heritage. This includes training on digitization techniques, conservation methods, and archival management practices.

4. __Digitization and Digital Preservation__: Invest in digitization initiatives to create digital copies of fragile or endangered documentary materials. Develop digital preservation strategies to ensure the long-term accessibility and sustainability of digital collections. UNESCO's Memory of the World program promotes the digitization and preservation of documentary heritage worldwide.

5. __Awareness Raising and Advocacy__: Raise awareness among the general public, policymakers, and stakeholders about the importance of preserving documentary heritage. Advocate for increased funding, resources, and support for preservation efforts through campaigns, events, and educational initiatives.

6. __Community Engagement and Participation__: Involve local communities, indigenous groups, and marginalized populations in the preservation of their documentary heritage. Encourage grassroots initiatives, community-based archives, and oral history projects that empower communities to safeguard their cultural heritage.

7. __International Conventions and Agreements__: Ratify and implement international conventions and agreements related to the preservation of cultural heritage, such as the UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage and the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict.

8. __Emergency Preparedness and Response__: Develop protocols and mechanisms for emergency preparedness and response to protect documentary heritage during natural disasters, armed conflicts, and other emergencies. This includes risk assessment, disaster planning, and emergency salvage operations.

9. __Research and Documentation__: Support research initiatives to document and study documentary heritage, including its historical significance, cultural contexts, and socio-political implications. Encourage interdisciplinary collaboration and the exchange of knowledge and expertise.

10. __Sustainable Funding Mechanisms__: Establish sustainable funding mechanisms for the preservation of documentary heritage, including public-private partnerships, philanthropic support, and dedicated funding streams from governments and international organizations.

__*By implementing these strategies and fostering international cooperation, the preservation of the documentary heritage of humankind can be effectively safeguarded for future generations.*__
