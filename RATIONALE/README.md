RATIONALE
=========
* This is an explanation of the rationale behind everything that I, A.G., do as a person and as an artist in my illustrious artistic practise.
* Imagine for a moment that you are homeless. You have no worldly possessions except a few things.
  * You have some basic units of clothing, you have shoes, and you have a GitHub account.
  * That's all you need. I will explain soon. GitHub is my home now. It is my most critical possession as a person and as an artist. It is what allows me to be held most accountable for all that I say and do, even my thoughts are being scrutinized.

* Here are some accounts you will want to create, should you want to transcend GitHub itself:
 - [ORCID ID] (https://orcid.org/)
 - [Figshare] (http://figshare.com/)
 - [ZENODO] (https://zenodo.org/)
 - [GitHub] (http://github.com/)
* ORCID
 * ORCID is an open, non-profit, community-driven effort to create and maintain a registry of unique researcher identifiers and a transparent method of linking research activities and outputs to these identifiers. ORCID is unique in its ability to reach across disciplines, research sectors and national boundaries. It is a hub that connects researchers and research through the embedding of ORCID identifiers in key workflows, such as research profile maintenance, manuscript submissions, grant applications, and patent applications. 
* Figshare
 * figshare is a repository where users can make all of their research outputs available in a citable, shareable and discoverable manner.
* ZENODO
 * ZENODO builds and operate a simple and innovative service that enables researchers, scientists, EU projects and institutions to share and showcase multidisciplinary research results (data and publications) that are not part of the existing institutional or subject-based repositories of the research communities.
 *ZENODO enables researchers, scientists, EU projects and institutions to:
  * easily share the long tail of small research results in a wide variety of formats including text, spreadsheets, audio,
  * video, and images across all fields of science.
  * display their research results and get credited by making the research results citable and integrate them into existing
  * reporting lines to funding agencies like the European Commission.
  * easily access and reuse shared research results.
* WITH THESE TOOLS, THE SKY IS THE LIMIT. MORE TO COME ON THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES.
